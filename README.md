2. An android device (A phone or a tablet or an emulator) with an active internet connection.

<br> In case you don't have a secret key, the app will guide you on how to get one for free.

*If you are still facing issues with setting up the secret key, you can always find answers on the internet*

## Permissions
The app only requires file access permission if you want to download the notes as pdf to your android device. <br>
All of the app data is stored in a secure manner on the device itself.

## Feedback
